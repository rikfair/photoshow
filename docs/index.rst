Photoshow - *"Fullscreen continuous slideshow"*
===============================================

Photoshow is a simple fullscreen slideshow, with configurable options to display your images in your way.
They can be ordered, random, timed or user led, by pressing the button to continue.
As photos have differing ratios, each is centered on a white saturated abstract of the image, to avoid frame glare.
An optional caption can be added based on the Exif data, filename, or folder name to complete each slide.

Just point photoshow to the image folder and sit back.
